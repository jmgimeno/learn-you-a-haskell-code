-- Wrapping an Existing Type into a New Type

-- In chapter 11, we saw a couple of ways for the list type to be an
-- applicative functor. One way is using <*>:
[(+1),(*100),(*5)] <*> [1,2,3]
-- [2,3,4,100,200,400,5,10,15]

-- The second way was using ZipLists:
getZipList $ ZipList [(+1),(*100),(*5)] <*> ZipList [1,2,3]
-- [2,200,15]

-- Because [] was already an instance of Applicative, we could declare
-- ZipList as:
data ZipList a = ZipList [a]
-- it only has one constructor and it has just one field. Using record
-- syntax:
data ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [a] }

-- In the libraries ZipList is defined like:
newtype ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [a] }

-- Why newtype?
--
-- It was made exactly for the cases when you want to wrap a type to
-- present it as a different type.
--
-- newtype is faster... There is some overhead using data to wrap/unwrap
-- values when the program is running. Using newtype, Haskell knows you're
-- just wrapping an existing type (same internally, but different type). It
-- then can get rid of all the wrapping/unwrapping
--
-- newtype can only have one value constructor and that constructor can
-- only have one field.
--
-- newtype declarations can also derive from other type classes. But the
-- type you're wrapping must already be an instance of that class!

newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [Char] } deriving (Eq, Show)

CharList "this will be shown!"
-- CharList {getCharList = "this will be shown!"}
CharList "benny" == CharList "benny"
-- True
CharList "benny" == CharList "oysters"
-- False

-- In this particular newtype, the value constructor has the following type
CharList :: [Char] -> CharList
-- getCharList has type
getCharList :: CharList -> [Char]
-- this could be thought of as wrapping/unwrapping or as converting values
-- between types


-- Using newtype to Make Type Class Instances
--
-- We sometimes want to make our type instances of certain classes, but the
-- type parameters don't match.
--
-- What if we want to make the tuple an instance of Functor such that when
-- we fmap a function over a tuple, it is applied to the first component
-- of the tuple? eg fmap (+3) (1,1) => (4,1)
newtype Pair b a = Pair { getPair :: (a,b) }

instance Functor (Pair c) where
    fmap f (Pair (x, y)) = Pair (f x, y)

:t fmap
-- fmap :: (a -> b) -> Pair c a -> Pair c b
getPair $ fmap (*100) (Pair (2,3))
-- (200,3)
getPair $ fmap reverse (Pair ("london calling",3))
-- ("gnillac nodnol",3)


-- On newtype laziness
--
-- values that are created using newtype are lazier than those that are
-- created otherwise. We can see this when using undefined.

-- trying to evaluate undefined, haskell throws an exception
undefined
-- *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

-- if we have a list with some values undefined and ask for the head
-- everything is fine as it only needs to evaluate the first element:
head [3,4,5,undefined,2,undefined]
-- 3

-- consider the following:
data CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }
helloMe :: CoolBool -> String
helloMe (CoolBool _) = "hello"
-- helloMe returns "hello" regardless of the input being True or False

-- Instead of giving helloMe a Bool:
helloMe undefined
-- *** Exception: Prelude.undefined
-- Even though we said that it didn't matter what the parameter was in the
-- helloMe definition...
--
-- Types defined with data can have multiple value constructors (even
-- though ours has only one). So Haskell is forced to evaluate the
-- parameters just enough in order to see which constructor was used to
-- create the value

newtype CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }
helloMe :: CoolBool -> String
helloMe (CoolBool _) = "hello"

helloMe undefined
-- "hello"
-- This worked because Haskell knows that types made with newtype can have
-- only one constructor, it doesn't need to evaluate the value passed to
-- the function to make sure it conforms to the (CoolBool _) pattern.

-- data and newtype behave similarly from the outside, but they are really
-- two different mechanisms. Data can be used to make completely new types,
-- newtype is just for making a new type out of an existing type. Pattern
-- matching on newtype values isn't like taking something out of a box (as
-- it is with data), but more like direct type conversion.


-- Type vs newtype vs data

-- type is for making type synonyms.
type IntList = [Int]
([1,2,3] :: IntList) ++ ([1,2,3] :: [Int])
-- [1,2,3,1,2,3]
-- we use type synonyms to make our type signatures more descriptive
-- eg from Chapter 7
type PhoneBook = [(String,String)]

-- newtype is for taking existing types and wrapping them in new types
-- mostly so that it's easier to make them instances of certain type
-- classes. the newtype is separate from the original type. Given:
newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [Char] }
-- we can not use ++ to put together CharList and [Char]
--
-- Using record syntax in newtype declarations we get functions for
-- converting between the types: The value constructor and the extractor
-- function.

-- data is for making our own data types: Many constructors each with many
-- fields.

-- summary:
-- type: you want to just make type synonyms to look cleaner and be more
--       descriptive.
-- newtype: you want to take an existing type and wrap it in order to make
--          it an instance of a type class
-- data: you want to make something completely new.
